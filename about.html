      <p>For project 3, I decided to create a world using HTML, CSS, and three.js. This is my first project using three.js so I was playing around learning how to use this library. I had many different concepts in mind when I was first introduced to this project. After taking into consideration the timeline for how long I get to work on this project and also learning an unfamiliar library at the same time, I decided to keep it simple and create a virtual nature world of trees. I got inspiration from other digital artists online to create a space where you can orbit and look around 360 degrees to make the viewer feel immersed. 3D models that I imported into my website were all gltf files from Sktechfab. I wanted to add more 3D models but the bigger the files were the slower my website would load. </p>
